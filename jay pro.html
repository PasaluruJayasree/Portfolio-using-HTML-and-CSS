        <p>E-PLACEMENT CELL is a web-based application developed for the training and placement 
            department of the college in order to provide up-to-date information about all the drives and the students in the 
            college. It helps the faculty to overcome the difficulty of keeping the records manually regarding students and 
            drives and reduces the time which makes it easy and effective work. It acts as a bridge between students and the 
            training and placement officer in the college. It contains separate logins for students and admin which contain 
            separate services for both.
